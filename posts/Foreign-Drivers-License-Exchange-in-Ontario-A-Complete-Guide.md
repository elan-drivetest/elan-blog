If you've recently moved to Ontario from another country, one of your first priorities is likely to get a local driver's license. Fortunately, Ontario offers a driver's license exchange program that allows eligible newcomers to convert their existing license without starting from scratch.

In this guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to know about exchanging a foreign driver's license in Ontarioâ€”including eligibility, required documents, countries with reciprocal agreements, and what to expect if you need to take a test.

## **What Is the Foreign Driver's License Exchange?**

Ontario's driver's license exchange program allows drivers from certain countries to convert their foreign license into an Ontario licenseâ€”often without having to take a written or road test. This process is managed by ServiceOntario and DriveTest centres.

## **Who Is Eligible?**

You may be eligible for a license exchange if:

* You're at least 16 years old

* You hold a valid, non-expired foreign driver's license

* You're legally allowed to drive in Ontario (e.g., you are a resident or new immigrant)

* Your country has a reciprocal agreement with Ontario

## **Countries with License Exchange Agreements**

If your current driver's license comes from a country where you have a consensus agreement, you will not need to take information or a road test as long as you apply for a license within 90 days of your arrival in Canada. Eligible countries include:

* ***Australia***

* ***Austria***

* ***Belgium***

* ***France***

* ***Germany***

* ***Ireland***

* ***Japan***

* ***Netherlands***

* ***New Zealand***

* ***South Korea***

* ***Switzerland***

* ***Taiwan***

* ***United Kingdom***

* ***United States***

**Required Documents**

When visiting a DriveTest or ServiceOntario centre, bring:

* **Original foreign driver's license** 

* **Proof of driving experience (e.g., driver's abstract, letter from licensing agency)**

* **Proof of identity and Ontario residency**

* **Completed G1/G2 application form**

* **Applicable fees**

Tip: If your license is not in English or French, you'll need an official translation from an approved translator or embassy.

## **What Happens If Your Country Isn't on the List?**

If your country is not part of Ontario's license exchange agreement, you must follow Ontario's Graduated Licensing System:

1. Pass the G1 knowledge test

2. Complete a vision test

3. Pass the G2 road test

4. After practice or lessons, pass the G road test (for a full licence)

If you have more than 24 months of driving experience (with documentation), you may be eligible to skip the G2 wait period.

## **Costs Involved**

* ***Knowledge test**: \~$16*

* ***G2 road test**: \~$53*

* ***G road test**: \~$91*

* ***License card**: \~$90 (valid for 5 years)*

* ***Translation or abstract services**: Varies*

## **Final Thoughts**

Exchanging your foreign driver's license in Ontario can be quick and straightforwardâ€”if you qualify and bring the right documents. If you don't, don't worry: Ontario's GDL system offers a clear path to full licensing.

No matter where you're from, the goal is the same: to drive safely and legally on Ontario roads.
