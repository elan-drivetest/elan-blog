### **What's Your Situation?**

* "*My license is about to expire*" → **Renew it**
* "*My license is lost, stolen, or looks like a soggy napkin*" → **Replace it**
* "*My name or address changed*" → **Update it**

### **When Should You Renew Your Driver's License?**

### **Where to Renew Your Driver's License**

You can renew:

* Online via [ServiceOntario's renewal portal](https://www.ontario.ca/page/renew-drivers-licence)
* In person at any ServiceOntario location
* Some locations require appointments—check [ServiceOntario](https://www.ontario.ca/locations/serviceontario) before you go.

### **What You Need to Renew**

To renew your license, you'll typically need:

* Your current driver's license
* A valid health card (if renewing online)
* Payment method for the renewal fee *(usually $90)*

**You may also be required to:**

* Update your photo (every 10 years)
* Take an eye test (especially for seniors 80+)
* Disclose any medical conditions

### **How to Replace a Lost, Stolen, or Damaged License**

If your license is:

* Lost
* Stolen
* Damaged
* Changed your name or address

You must get a replacement from [ServiceOntario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/replace-drivers-licence).

You can do this:

* In person at a ServiceOntario centre
* Or online if your address is current and you don't need a new photo

You'll need:

* One piece of valid ID
* To confirm your identity
* Pay the replacement fee *(usually around $35)*

If your license was stolen, report it to police and request a police report number.

### **When Will You Get Your New License?**

You'll receive a temporary paper license on the spot if renewing or replacing in person. Your new plastic card will arrive by mail within 4–6 weeks.

If renewing online, you'll continue using your current card until the new one arrives.

### **Important Notes**

* *If your license has expired for more than 1 year, you may need to reapply and retake tests.*
* *If you're a G2 driver and your license is expiring, you should book your G test first to avoid retaking the G2 test.*
* *If your address or name has changed, be sure to update your info before renewing.*
* *Make sure to keep your temporary paper license while your new one is being processed.*
* *Make sure your license is updated, or you won't be allowed for the drive test.*

### **Final Thought**
