Winter driving in Canada is no joke. Between icy roads, freezing temperatures, and surprise snowstorms, your car needs to be prepared just like you prepare yourself.

Whether you're taking your G2 or G road test or just commuting to school or work, a winter-ready car isn't optional, it's essential!

Here are 5 easy steps to make sure your vehicle is safe, reliable, and ready to handle whatever winter throws at it.

## **1. Swap to Winter Tires**

All-season tires just don't cut it when the temperature drops below 7Â°C.

Winter tires are built for icy, slushy, and snowy roads offering better grip, shorter stopping distances, and improved control.

**Tip:** Look for the mountain snowflake symbol on the tire which indicates that it's rated for real winter conditions.

## **2. Test Your Battery**

Cold temperatures drain car batteries faster. If your battery is older than 3 years, get it tested before winter hits.

No one wants to be stuck in a frozen parking lot with a car that won't start.

**Note:** A weak battery in winter = a high chance of a no-start morning.

## **3. Check Wipers, Fluids, and Defrosters**

Visibility is everything in winter driving.

* Replace old wiper blades
* Top up with winter-grade washer fluid (it won't freeze)
* Make sure your defrosters and heater are working properly

**Bonus tip:** Keep an ice scraper in your car â€” not in your trunk!

## **4. Pack an Emergency Kit**

Your emergency kit doesn't have to be fancy, it just needs to be practical.

**Essentials include:**
* Blanket or thermal wrap
* Flashlight
* Jumper cables
* First-aid kit
* Shovel and traction aid (like kitty litter or sand)
* Phone charger and power bank

Keeping this kit in your trunk can make all the difference in a winter emergency.

## **5. Book a Test-Ready Vehicle for Winter Driving**

If you're taking your G2 or G road test this winter, make sure your test car is fully winter-ready and meets DriveTest safety standards.

* âœ… Winter ready
* âœ… Insured
* âœ… Prepped for road tests

With a little prep and the right support, you can stay safe, stay warm, and stay on the road no matter how cold the road gets.

Don't risk failing because of your car. Book with Elan and show up warm, safe, and ready to pass.
