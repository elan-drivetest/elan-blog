Learning to drive in Toronto comes with its challenges like traffic, construction, and confusing signs, just to name a few. But did you know that some areas in Toronto are off-limits for driving instruction?

Whether you're a G1 or G2 learner, taking lessons in a restricted area can result in fines, safety concerns, or even failed tests. Here are six places you shouldn't be driving‚Äîand some safe, legal alternatives to help you practice with confidence.

### **1\. High Park**

High Park is a popular recreation spot, but it's not meant for driving lessons. The narrow roads, high pedestrian traffic, and strict park rules make it unsafe‚Äîand illegal‚Äîfor driver training.

**‚û°Ô∏è Instead, try:** Nearby residential streets like Ellis Avenue or Windermere Avenue, especially during off-peak hours.

### **2\. Don Valley Parkway (DVP)**

One of Toronto's busiest expressways, the DVP is restricted for all driving instruction. New drivers are not permitted to practice on this highway, especially under a G1 licence.

**‚û°Ô∏è Instead, try:** Practicing highway skills later on quieter routes like Highway 7 or the 427 under the supervision of a licensed instructor (and with a G2 or higher).

### **3\. The Gardiner Expressway**

Another major highway in Toronto, the Gardiner is high-speed and high-risk for learners. It's also restricted under G1 licence conditions.

**‚û°Ô∏è Instead, try:** Practicing on controlled-access roads like Allen Road or quieter sections of Highway 400 (G2 only, with qualified supervision).

### **4\. Downtown Core (Bay Street, Queen, King)**

While not officially banned, Toronto's downtown core is highly discouraged for early-stage learners. The mix of streetcars, cyclists, heavy congestion, and one-way streets creates unnecessary stress and risk.

**‚û°Ô∏è Instead, try:** Practicing in midtown or suburban areas like North York or Etobicoke to build confidence before entering the core.

### **5\. Private Parking Lots (Without Permission)**

Using a mall or condo parking lot for practice without permission is not only risky, it's technically trespassing. Many lots are monitored, and you could face warnings or fines.

**‚û°Ô∏è** **Instead, try:** Publicly accessible practice areas near DriveTest centres or request permission from smaller plazas during non-peak hours.

### **6\. School Zones During Active Hours**

Practicing in school zones especially during arrival or dismissal puts young pedestrians at risk and creates unsafe conditions for new drivers.

**‚û°Ô∏è** **Instead, try:** Returning to these zones only outside school hours for practice with speed limits and signage.

## **Why These Restrictions Exist**

Restricted driving areas in Toronto are in place to protect both new drivers and the public. Heavy traffic, fast speeds, and complex layouts can overwhelm even experienced drivers, so it's best to build skills gradually in controlled environments.

## **Tips for Safe, Legal Practice**

* Always obey the conditions of your licence (G1 drivers must be accompanied by a fully licensed driver with 4+ years experience).

* Avoid high-speed roads and expressways until you have a G2 licence.

* Practice in designated learning areas, like those around [DriveTest centres](https://drivetest.ca), which are designed for real test conditions.
