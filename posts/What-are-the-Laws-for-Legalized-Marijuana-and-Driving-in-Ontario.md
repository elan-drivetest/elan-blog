Since the legalization of marijuana in Canada, many Ontarians have questions about what it means for road safety and driving laws. While cannabis is legal, driving under its influence is illegal and dangerous. In this post, we'll break down the laws around marijuana and driving in Ontario, the penalties for impaired driving, and how you can stay on the right side of the law.

### *"Is It Legal to Drive After Consuming Marijuana in Ontario?"*

No. Even though recreational cannabis is legal, it is illegal to drive while impaired by marijuana. Ontario has strict drug-impaired driving laws that apply to all drivers—regardless of age or license level.

### **Key Cannabis and Driving Laws in Ontario**

#### **1\. Zero Tolerance for Young, Novice, and Commercial Drivers**

If you fall under any of the following categories, zero tolerance applies:

* Drivers aged 21 and under

* G1, G2, M1, and M2 license holders

* Commercial vehicle drivers (trucks, buses, etc.)

This means you cannot have any cannabis in your system when driving. Law enforcement uses oral fluid screening devices to detect THC levels on the spot.

#### **2\. THC Limits for Fully Licensed Drivers**

For fully licensed (G or M class) drivers:

* **2 to 5 nanograms of THC per millilitre of blood**: *penalty range starts at a warning level*

* **Over 5 nanograms per millilitre**: *treated as a criminal offence*

Police can require a Standard Field Sobriety Test (SFST), oral fluid sample, or even a blood test.

#### **3\. Combination with Alcohol**

Driving with a combination of alcohol and THC in your system carries harsher penalties, even if both substances are under individual legal limits.

**Penalties for Drug-Impaired Driving in Ontario**

Being caught driving high can result in serious consequences, such as:

* **Immediate license suspension** (3–90 days)

* **Vehicle impoundment**

* **Monetary fines** (starting at $250)

* **Demerit points**

* **Criminal charges** and potential jail time for repeat offenders

### **What About Medical Marijuana Users?**

Even if you're prescribed medical marijuana, you're still not allowed to drive while impaired. Always consult with your doctor about how cannabis may affect your motor skills before getting behind the wheel.

### **How Can Drivers Stay Safe and Legal?**

* **Wait before you drive**: THC can impair you for up to 6 hours or more, depending on the strain and method of consumption.

* **Plan ahead**: Use a designated driver, taxi, or rideshare if you've consumed cannabis.

* **Keep cannabis out of reach**: It must be sealed and inaccessible to the driver to avoid charges under Ontario's cannabis transportation laws.

### **Know Before You Go**

Understanding the laws around cannabis and driving is just as important as knowing the road signs. Don't let a bad decision cost you your license or your life. Stay informed, stay sober when you're driving, and stay safe.
