Don't let simple mistakes ruin your G2 road test. With Ontario's G2 pass rate at just 53%, understanding what causes most failures can be the difference between getting your license and waiting months for another chance.

Here are the 7 most common mistakes that cause instant failureâ€”and exactly how to avoid them.

## **1. Rolling Through Stop Signs (35% of Failures)**

### **The Mistake:**
Coming to a "rolling stop" instead of a complete stop at stop signs, red lights, or pedestrian crosswalks.

### **What Examiners Look For:**
* Complete cessation of forward movement
* Stopping before the stop line or crosswalk
* Counting "1-Mississippi, 2-Mississippi" before proceeding
* Looking left, right, and left again

### **How to Avoid It:**
* **Practice the "Rock Test":** Your car should rock slightly backward when you stop completely
* **Use the 3-Second Rule:** Count to three after stopping before moving
* **Stop Behind Lines:** Always stop before crosswalks and stop lines, not on them

**Pro Tip:** Even if traffic is flowing, you MUST come to a complete stop at stop signs.

## **2. Forgetting Shoulder Checks (28% of Failures)**

### **The Mistake:**
Failing to physically turn your head to check blind spots before:
* Changing lanes
* Merging
* Parallel parking
* Backing up
* Pulling away from curb

### **What Examiners Look For:**
* Obvious head movement (not just eyes)
* Checking before AND during maneuvers
* Looking over the correct shoulder
* Timing checks appropriately

### **How to Avoid It:**
* **Exaggerate Head Movement:** Make it obvious you're checking
* **Mirror-Signal-Shoulder Check:** Follow this sequence religiously
* **Check Multiple Times:** Once before signaling, once before moving

**Remember:** Mirror checks alone are NOT sufficientâ€”you must turn your head.

## **3. Improper Lane Changes (22% of Failures)**

### **The Mistake:**
* Changing lanes without signaling
* Cutting off other vehicles
* Not checking blind spots
* Signaling but not actually changing lanes when safe

### **What Examiners Look For:**
* Signal at least 30 meters before changing
* Adequate spacing (3-second gap minimum)
* Smooth, confident lane changes
* Proper positioning in new lane

### **How to Avoid It:**
* **Use the 5-Step Process:**
  1. Check rearview mirror
  2. Signal your intention
  3. Check side mirror
  4. Shoulder check
  5. Change lanes smoothly

* **Practice Timing:** Signal early, but don't change until it's safe

## **4. Speed Control Issues (20% of Failures)**

### **The Mistake:**
* Driving too slowly (10+ km/h under limit)
* Driving too fast for conditions
* Not adjusting speed in school zones
* Inconsistent speed control

### **What Examiners Look For:**
* Maintaining appropriate speed for conditions
* Smooth acceleration and deceleration
* Recognizing and adjusting for speed zones
* Confidence in speed management

### **How to Avoid It:**
* **Know Speed Limits:** 50 km/h residential, 40 km/h school zones
* **Drive with Traffic Flow:** Match surrounding vehicles' speed
* **Practice Smooth Control:** Avoid sudden speed changes
* **Watch for Signs:** Reduce speed in school and construction zones

**Key Point:** Being overly cautious (driving too slowly) can fail you just as easily as speeding.

## **5. Parallel Parking Problems (18% of Failures)**

### **The Mistake:**
* Hitting the curb
* Parking too far from curb (over 30 cm)
* Taking too many attempts
* Blocking traffic during the maneuver

### **What Examiners Look For:**
* Smooth entry into parking space
* Proper distance from curb (15-30 cm)
* Completing maneuver efficiently
* Checking mirrors and blind spots

### **How to Avoid It:**
* **Learn Reference Points:** Use specific visual markers
* **Practice the Sequence:**
  1. Pull alongside front car
  2. Reverse until your mirror aligns with their bumper
  3. Turn wheel fully right
  4. Reverse until 45-degree angle
  5. Straighten wheel and continue backing
  6. Turn wheel left to straighten

* **Practice in Real Conditions:** Use actual parked cars, not just cones

## **6. Poor Intersection Habits (15% of Failures)**

### **The Mistake:**
* Entering intersection on yellow/red lights
* Not yielding right-of-way properly
* Stopping in intersection during traffic
* Confusion at 4-way stops

### **What Examiners Look For:**
* Stopping before intersection on yellow (if safe to do so)
* Proper right-of-way understanding
* Clear intersection protocol
* Confident decision-making

### **How to Avoid It:**
* **Yellow Light Rule:** If you can stop safely, you must stop
* **Right-of-Way Priority:** 
  1. Emergency vehicles
  2. Pedestrians in crosswalks
  3. Right-turning traffic (from left)
  4. Straight-through traffic

* **4-Way Stop Protocol:** First to stop, first to go; if simultaneous, right vehicle has right-of-way

## **7. Inadequate Observation (12% of Failures)**

### **The Mistake:**
* Not checking mirrors frequently enough
* Missing pedestrians or cyclists
* Poor scanning of surroundings
* Not noticing important road signs

### **What Examiners Look For:**
* Regular mirror checks (every 5-8 seconds)
* Scanning intersections before entering
* Awareness of pedestrians and cyclists
* Recognition of road signs and markings

### **How to Avoid It:**
* **Develop Scanning Habits:** Constantly move eyes to check surroundings
* **Use the Commentary Method:** Mentally narrate what you see
* **Check Mirrors Religiously:** Before any maneuver and regularly while driving
* **Practice Situational Awareness:** Look for potential hazards constantly

## **Bonus Mistakes That Hurt Your Score**

### **Minor But Common Errors:**
* **Hand positioning:** Keep hands at 9 and 3 o'clock
* **Seat adjustment:** Adjust before starting, not during test
* **Signal cancellation:** Turn off signals after completing turns
* **Following distance:** Maintain 3-second gap minimum

## **Pre-Test Checklist to Avoid Failures**

### **Before You Start:**
- [ ] Adjust seat, mirrors, and steering wheel
- [ ] Fasten seatbelt
- [ ] Turn off mobile phone
- [ ] Ask questions if unclear about instructions

### **During the Test:**
- [ ] Come to complete stops
- [ ] Check blind spots before every maneuver
- [ ] Signal early and appropriately
- [ ] Maintain proper speed
- [ ] Stay calm and confident

### **Mental Preparation:**
- [ ] Get good night's sleep
- [ ] Eat light meal beforehand
- [ ] Arrive 30 minutes early
- [ ] Practice relaxation breathing

## **What to Do If You Make a Mistake**

### **Stay Calm:**
* One mistake doesn't automatically mean failure
* Acknowledge the error mentally and move on
* Don't let it affect the rest of your driving
* Focus on executing remaining maneuvers perfectly

### **Recovery Strategies:**
* If you roll through a stop sign, make extra-sure stops for the rest of the test
* If you forget a shoulder check, be more obvious with remaining checks
* If you have speed issues, focus on smooth, appropriate speed control

## **Test Day Success Formula**

**The Night Before:**
* Review these common mistakes
* Get adequate sleep (7-8 hours)
* Prepare all documents and test requirements

**Test Day Morning:**
* Light breakfast with protein
* Arrive early to settle nerves
* Do practice maneuvers in parking lot if possible

**During Test:**
* Listen carefully to examiner instructions
* Drive slightly more cautiously than normal
* Make your safety checks obvious
* Stay confident and positive

## **Why These Mistakes Happen**

### **Root Causes:**
* **Nerves:** Test anxiety leads to forgetting basics
* **Overconfidence:** Assuming you don't need to practice fundamentals
* **Bad Habits:** Practicing incorrect techniques
* **Inadequate Preparation:** Not understanding what examiners look for

### **The Solution:**
Practice these specific skills until they become automatic, so nerves won't derail your performance.

## **Final Success Tip**

The key to avoiding these mistakes is **consistent practice with purpose**. Don't just driveâ€”practice the specific skills that examiners evaluate.
