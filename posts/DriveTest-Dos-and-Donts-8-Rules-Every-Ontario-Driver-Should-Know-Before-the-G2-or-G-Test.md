Passing your G2 or G road test in Ontario isnâ€™t just about knowing how to drive â€” itâ€™s about knowing the rules that *examiners look for*. And letâ€™s face it: with all the myths out there, it can be hard to know whatâ€™s true.

In this guide, weâ€™re clearing up the confusion with 8 essential DriveTest rules every new driver needs to know â€” including what you can and canâ€™t do during your G2 or G road test.

### **What You Can Do During Your DriveTest**

#### **1\. Ask Questions Before You Begin**

If you're confused about instructions or where to go, itâ€™s perfectly fine to ask the examiner before the car starts moving. Clarity \= confidence.

#### **2\. Adjust Mirrors and Seat**

Examiners actually expect you to adjust your seat, mirrors, and steering wheel before you drive off. It shows you care about safety.

#### **3\. Take Your Time â€” Within Reason**

This isnâ€™t a race. As long as you follow the flow of traffic and make safe decisions, taking a few extra seconds to double-check is okay.

#### **4\. Recover From Small Mistakes**

Forgot to shoulder check once? If you catch it and adjust, it might not hurt your score. Stay calm and donâ€™t let one slip-up ruin your drive.

### **What You *Canâ€™t* Do During Your DriveTest**

#### **1\. Use Your Phone (At All\!)**

Even if it's on silent or mounted, *donâ€™t touch it*. This is considered distracted driving  and could lead to an immediate failure.

#### **2\. Skip Safety Checks**

Rolling through stop signs, missing mirror checks, or failing to signal? These small things add up quickly and can fail you fast.

#### **3\. Drive Too Slowly or Hesitate Excessively**

Being overly cautious might make the examiner think youâ€™re unsure or unsafe. Maintain confidence and follow the speed limit.

#### **4\. Rely on GPS or Coaching**

Only follow the examinerâ€™s instructions â€” no GPS, AirPods, or help from your mom in the back seat.

### **Avoid the \#1 DriveTest Disappointment: A Cancelled Test**

Many road tests in Ontario get canceled because of car issues like bald tires, dead brake lights, or even cracked windshields. If your car doesnâ€™t meet DriveTestâ€™s vehicle requirements, your appointment could be canceled â€” with no refund.
