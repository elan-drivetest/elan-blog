Alberta follows a Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) program, which includes two major milestones: the Class 7 Learner's License and the Class 5 Driver's License (both probationary and full).

In this step-by-step guide, we'll break down everything you need to know to go from learner to fully licensed driver in Alberta—confidently and correctly in 2025\.

## **Step 1: Get Your Class 7 Learner's License**

### **What is a Class 7 License?**

A Class 7 license is the same as a G1 license used in most provinces.It allows you to begin learning how to drive with a supervising driver. It's the first step toward becoming a fully licensed driver in Alberta.

### **Eligibility Requirements:**

* Must be at least 14 years old

* Must pass a vision test

* Must pass a written knowledge test on Alberta traffic laws and signs

* Provide valid identification (proof of age, identity, and Alberta residency)

## **Class 7 Restrictions:**

* *Zero alcohol tolerance*

* *Must drive with a fully licensed driver (Class 5 non-GDL or higher) who is 18+*

* *No driving between midnight and 5 a.m.*

* *Cannot supervise other learners*

* *8 demerit point limit*

## **Step 2: Practice Driving (Minimum 12 Months)**

After obtaining your Class 7, you must practice for a minimum of 12 months before you can take the road test for a Class 5 license.

### **What to Practice:**

* *Safe turning, lane changes, merging*

* *Parking (parallel, hill, and reverse)*

* *Navigating intersections and roundabouts*

* *Driving in residential, urban, and highway settings*

**Tip:** Enroll in a licensed driver training course. It improves your skills and can lower insurance premiums.

## **Step 3: Take the Class 5 GDL Road Test**

Once you've held your Class 7 for at least one year, you're eligible to book your Class 5 GDL road test.

### **Requirements:**

* Be 16 years or older

* Have had your Class 7 license for 12 months or more

* Pass the basic road test

**Where to Book:**

Visit [MyAlberta eServices](https://eservices.alberta.ca/book-a-drivers-road-test.html) or a local registry office.

### **What's Tested:**

* Traffic observation and awareness

* Speed control and decision-making

* Parking techniques and vehicle handling

* Proper signaling and lane usage

**Note:** One of the top reasons road tests get canceled on the spot is unsafe, uninsured, or non-compliant vehicles. Show up with a fully insured, test-approved rental from Elan—so you can focus on passing, not paperwork.

## **Step 4: Hold Your Class 5 GDL License for 2 Years**

Once you pass the road test, you'll receive your Class 5 GDL (Graduated Driver's License).

### **Restrictions Include:**

* Zero alcohol/drug tolerance

* Cannot supervise another learner

* 8 demerit point limit

* Must hold for 24 months before upgrading

## **Step 5: Upgrade to Full Class 5 License (Non-GDL)**

After 2 years with no suspensions or violations, you're eligible to upgrade to a full 

Class 5 license.

### **Benefits of Class 5 (Non-GDL):**

* No more GDL restrictions

* Ability to supervise other learners

* Lower insurance rates

* More driving freedom

**How to Upgrade:**

Visit an Alberta registry office to apply. No additional test is required if your driving record is clean.
