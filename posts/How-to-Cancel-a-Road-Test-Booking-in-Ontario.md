Did you know if you cancel your driving test less than 48 hours in advance‚Äîor fail to show up at all, you'll lose your entire road test fee? That means no refund, no reschedule, and no second chance without paying all over again. This can delay your driving journey by weeks or even months, especially during peak testing seasons when appointment slots are limited.

Don't forget to cancel/reschedule 48 hours in advance to ensure you don't lose your test fee or face future inconveniences. 

### **Three Easy Ways to Cancel**

You can cancel your road test in any of these ways:

* **Online**: Visit the [DriveTest website](https://drivetest.ca).

* **By Phone**: Call 1-888-570-6110.

* **In Person**: Go to any DriveTest Centre in Ontario.

### **What You'll Need**

Before you cancel, make sure you have the following details ready:

* Your Ontario driver's license number

* The test type (G2 or G)

* The date and location of your appointment

### **Want to Reschedule Instead?**

If something comes up and you need to change your road test date, you won't have to pay extra. As long as you cancel at least 48 hours before your scheduled test, rescheduling is completely free. When you go to cancel your appointment, you'll also have the chance to pick a new date and time that better fits your schedule. 

### **Confirm the Cancellation**

After canceling or rescheduling your road test, it's important to double-check that everything went through properly. Look out for a confirmation email in your inbox it should arrive shortly after your request. If you don't see it, log in to your DriveTest account to verify that the changes have been successfully updated. Taking a moment to confirm ensures you won't run into any surprises on your test day.
