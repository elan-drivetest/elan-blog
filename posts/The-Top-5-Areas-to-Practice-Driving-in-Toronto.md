# The Top 5 Areas to Practice Driving in Toronto

Just got your G1 or practicing for your G2 test? Congrats! Now comes the real testâ€”getting comfortable behind the wheel.

Toronto may be a busy city, but it's full of hidden gems and quiet streets where new drivers can build confidence and sharpen their skills. Whether you're preparing for your G2 test or just trying to get comfortable with city driving, here are the top 5 best areas to practice driving in Toronto.

## **1. Don Mills â€“ North York**

**Why it's great:** Don Mills is one of Toronto's most driver-friendly neighbourhoods. It has wide residential streets, light traffic, and plenty of 4-way stopsâ€”perfect for mastering right-of-way rules and smooth turns.

**What to practice here:**
* *Stop signs and 3-way/4-way intersections*
* *Residential speed control (30â€“40 km/h zones)*
* *Lane changes on Don Mills Road*

**Bonus:** Nearby parking lots at Fairview Mall are great for parallel parking and reversing practice.

## **2. Eglinton & Markham Road â€“ Scarborough**

**Why it's great:** Scarborough is home to one of the main DriveTest centres, and this area mirrors the real G2 and G test routes. Practicing here gives you a real advantage when it comes time to take the test.

**What to practice here:**
* *Left and right turns at major intersections*
* *Merging onto busy roads*
* *Speed transitions from 50 km/h to 80 km/h*

**Pro Tip:** Practice during both off-peak and peak hours to get used to different traffic conditions.

## **3. The Beaches â€“ East End Toronto**

**Why it's great:** The Beaches has a mix of quiet residential streets and light commercial traffic, giving new drivers the chance to practice in different environments. The slower pace of the area is ideal for beginners.

**What to practice here:**
* *Parallel parking along Queen Street East*
* *Right turns on red (with pedestrians around!)*
* *One-way streets and angled parking*

**Scenic Bonus:** You'll get a calming view of Lake Ontario after each round of practice.

## **4. York University Campus â€“ North Toronto**

**Why it's great:** Outside of school hours, York U's sprawling campus offers lots of open space, roundabouts, and parking scenarios. It's like a private driving lab for beginners.

**What to practice here:**
* *Navigating roundabouts*
* *Pedestrian-heavy areas*
* *Parking lot maneuvers*

**Caution:** Avoid practicing here during rush hours when classes are in session.

## **5. High Park â€“ West Toronto**

**Why it's great:** High Park and its surrounding residential roads offer a beautiful setting for learning to drive. Expect light traffic, slower speed zones, and lots of turning practice.

**What to practice here:**
* *Uphill and downhill parking*
* *Reversing into driveways or side streets*
* *Navigating tight roads with parked cars on both sides*

**Challenge:** Practice driving during events or weekends to simulate more crowded conditions. Extra caution is recommended for practicing in residential areas.

## **Final Driving Tips**

* Always practice during different times of day (morning, mid-day, and evening)
* Mix up your routes to gain confidence on main roads and side streets
* Don't forget to practice in light rain or cloudy conditionsâ€”you never know what test day will bring!
