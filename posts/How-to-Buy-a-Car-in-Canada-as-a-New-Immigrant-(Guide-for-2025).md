# How to Buy a Car in Canada as a New Immigrant (Guide for 2025)

**Everything You Need to Know—From Paperwork to Keys in Hand**

Starting a new chapter in Canada? Buying your first car in Ontario as a newcomer can feel overwhelming—but it doesn't have to be. Whether you're here on a work permit, as a permanent resident, or an international student, this guide will walk you through every step of the process.

## **Step 1: Check Your Licensing & Driving Eligibility**

Before buying a car, make sure you can legally drive in Ontario.

* Have an international licence? You can use it for up to 60 days.

* Planning to stay long-term? You'll need to exchange your licence or get an Ontario driver's licence.

Check how to get licensed here: [Ontario Driver's Licence Info](https://www.ontario.ca/page/drivers-licence)

**Step 2: Decide Between New or Used**

Buying new means peace of mind, but buying used is often more affordable.

**New Car:**
- Pros: Warranty, latest tech
- Cons: Expensive, higher insurance

**Used Car:**
- Pros: Cheaper, lower depreciation
- Cons: May need more maintenance

Tip: Start by browsing platforms like [AutoTrader](https://www.autotrader.ca), [Kijiji Autos](https://www.kijijiautos.ca), or visit local dealerships.

## **Step 3: Figure Out Financing**

As a newcomer, you might not have Canadian credit history yet—but you still have options.

**Financing Tips:**

* Some banks offer *newcomer auto loans* (try Scotiabank or RBC).

* You may need a larger down payment.

* Consider getting a co-signer with Canadian credit.

## **Step 4: Understand the Legal Paperwork**

When buying a used car in Ontario (especially in private sales), you'll need:

* *UVIP (Used Vehicle Information Package) – from the seller*

* *Bill of Sale – proof of purchase*

* *Safety Standards Certificate – to register the car*

* *Emissions test (if required)*

For all car registrations and legal requirements, check [ServiceOntario Vehicle Registration Page](https://www.ontario.ca/page/register-vehicle-permit-and-licence-plate)

## **Step 5: Get Insurance Before You Drive**

In Ontario, insurance is mandatory before you can drive your new car.

What you'll need:

* *Ontario driver's licence*

* *Vehicle info (VIN)*

* *Driving history (international if available)*

Compare insurance rates at: [Surex](https://www.surex.com) or [RateHub](https://www.ratehub.ca)

## **Step 6: Register & Plate Your Vehicle**

Once insured, head to a ServiceOntario centre with:

* Proof of insurance

* Licence

* Safety certificate

* Vehicle permit

* UVIP & Bill of Sale

They'll give you your vehicle ownership and Ontario plates.

## **Bonus Tips for Newcomers**

* *Bring a friend or translator if you're not confident in English yet.*

* *Test drive before buying—especially if buying used.*

* *Avoid "curbsiders" (illegal sellers posing as private owners).*

* *Ask if the car was in any previous accidents—use [CARFAX Canada](https://www.carfax.ca) to check.*
