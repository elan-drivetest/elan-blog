Getting your driver's license is a big milestone in independence and personal freedom. But did you know that many learners in Canada fail because of small but avoidable mistakes? From simply failing to signal  to misjudging speed limits, even the most prepared drivers can slip up under pressure.

But don’t worry—you're in the right place\! In this article, we’ll walk you through the **10 most common mistakes that can lead to failure** and, more importantly, **how to avoid them**. Follow these tips, and you’ll be well on your way to passing your driving test with confidence\! 

**Not Using Mirrors** 

One of the most common mistakes drivers make during their driving test is not using their mirrors correctly. This can lead to accidents, such as bumping into an object or even another vehicle. Always remember to check your side and rear-view mirror when taking a turn, changing lanes, or approaching junctions. Additionally, checking blind spots is a crucial step in ensuring the safety of both yourself and others on the road.

**Hesitating To Make A Decision**

Hesitation during driving can be a deadly mistake and it also signals a lack of confidence and poor decision-making, which can make examiners doubt your ability to handle real-world driving situations. Being overly cautious may seem like a safe approach, but in reality, it can be just as dangerous as reckless driving. Taking too long at stop signs, intersections, or roundabouts can confuse other drivers, ultimately disrupting the flow of traffic. To prevent hesitation you must study about road signs and right of way rules. Knowing the rules make you more confident in decision making. Use the look,decide and act method; 

● *Look at the situation (traffic, signals, pedestrians).*

*● Decide based on what you see (go, stop, yield, turn).*

***●** Act smoothly and confidently.*

**Rolling Stops**

A rolling stop happens when a driver fails to come to a complete stop at a stop sign or red light before proceeding. Instead of fully stopping, the vehicle slows down but continues moving—even if slightly. This common mistake can lead to test failure, fines, or accident.

### **How to avoid Rolling Stops** 

**● Knowing when to stop**: *Always come to a full stop at stop signs, red lights (unless turning where permitted), and pedestrian crossings.*

**● Count to Three**: *When you stop, count “1-2-3” while looking left, right, and ahead before moving.*

**● Check for Motion**: *Your car should feel completely still—no slight movement forward.*

**● Look for Markers**: *Stop before the white stop line, crosswalk, or intersection.*

**Over/Understeering** 

Oversteering and understeering is a significant issue in Canada, especially due to varying weather conditions like snow and ice, which can affect vehicle handling. Understanding these concepts is essential for safe driving.

Oversteering happens when the rear wheels lose traction, causing the back of the car to slide outwards while turning. This makes the car turn more than intended, increasing the risk of spinning out.

### **Causes of Oversteering**

● Entering a turn too fast

● Sudden or excessive steering input

● Slippery roads (ice, rain, gravel)

● Hard braking or acceleration while turning

### **How to Prevent & Correct Oversteering:**

*1.Slow Down Before Turns – Reduce speed before entering a curve, not during.*

*2.Steer Smoothly – Avoid jerky or aggressive steering inputs.*

*3.Ease Off the Gas – If the car starts to oversteer, gradually let off the accelerator instead of braking suddenly.*

*4.Counter-Steer Gently – If the rear slides, turn the steering wheel slightly in the opposite direction of the skid to regain control.*

Understeering happens when the front wheels lose traction, causing the car to continue straight instead of turning as intended. This is more common in front-wheel drive cars.

### **Causes of Understeering:**

**●** Entering a turn too fast

● Hard braking while turning

● Accelerating too much mid-turn

● Worn-out tires reducing grip

### **How to Prevent & Correct Understeering:**

1\.*Brake Before the Turn – Reduce speed before entering a curve, not during.*

*2.Look Where You Want to Go – This helps with proper steering input.*

*3.Ease Off the Gas & Steering – If understeering occurs, slowly release the accelerator and straighten the wheel slightly to regain grip.*

*4.Don’t Panic Brake – Sudden braking can make understeering worse.*

**Failing To Signal Correctly**

Failing to signal means not using your turn signals when changing lanes, turning, or merging, which can confuse other drivers and increase the risk of accidents.    To correct this, always signal early, ideally at least 30 meters before making a turn or lane change, so others have time to react. Before executing the move, check your mirrors and blind spots to ensure it's safe. After completing the turn or lane change, turn off your signal to avoid misleading other drivers. 

**Improper Lane Changes**

Changing lanes in an improper way can be very dangerous for both you and other drivers on the road. It’s always important to change the lane carefully by signalling properly and definitely not by overtaking other drivers.

**Overspeeding**

Overspeeding means driving faster than the posted speed limit or too fast for road conditions which results in accidents and fines. It’s one of the main causes of most accidents nowadays, as higher speeds reduce a driver’s ability to react quickly and increase the severity of crashes.High speeds can also cause your vehicle to lose control.

**How to avoid speeding:**

**●** *Follow speed limits—always check posted signs.*

**●** *Adjust for conditions—slow down in poor weather, heavy traffic, or unfamiliar areas.*

***Neglecting Observation Skills*** 

*Good observation skills are crucial for safe driving, and neglecting them can lead to failing your driving test or even accidents. Examiners look for drivers who are aware of their surroundings and can react appropriately.* Missing road signs, ignoring pedestrians and focusing only on the car ahead instead of scanning your surroundings can lead to failure.

**How to improve observation** 

*Scan Constantly – Regularly check mirrors, blind spots, and intersections while driving.*

*Look Ahead – Anticipate traffic flow, signals, and road hazards.*

*Use the ‘Mirror-Signal-Shoulder’ Rule – Always check mirrors and blind spots before making a move.*

**Parking** **Wrong** 

It is a common mistake parking too far from or too close to the curb, not aligning properly within parking lines, parking in a no-parking or handicapped zone without a permit, failing to use the parking brake on slopes. 

### **Quick Fix**

*1\. Follow Parking Signs – Always check for restrictions before parking.*

*2.Align Properly – Park within the lines and parallel to the curb.*

*3.Use Your Parking Brake – Especially on hills to prevent rolling.*

*4.Leave Enough Space – Ensure other vehicles and pedestrians can pass safely.*

***Getting overwhelmed***

While it’s very easy to panic under stress while driving, stay calm and maintain your composure as  mistakes made under heavy stress can lead to failure in your exam or even fatal accidents\!

**Conclusion** 

Understanding the top 10 reasons for failure can help you prepare and avoid these common mistakes. From not using mirrors to parking wrong, each error can easily be avoided with practice and awareness. The key to passing your test is staying calm, keeping safety in mind and most importantly, [confidence](https://grayjaysdrivingschool.ca/how-professional-driving-schools-help-new-drivers-gain-confidence/).
