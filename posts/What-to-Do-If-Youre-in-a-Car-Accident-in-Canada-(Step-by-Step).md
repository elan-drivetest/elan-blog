Thinking about being in a car accident can be scary but knowing exactly what to do can help you stay calm and protected. Whether it's a minor fender bender or a major collision, here's a comprehensive guide on what to do if you're in an accident in Canada.

## **1\. Stop Immediately**

It's illegal to leave the scene of an accident in Canada, even a small one. Pull over safely and turn on your hazard lights.

## **2\. Check for Injuries**

* Are you or anyone else in the vehicle hurt?

* Call 911 immediately if there are injuries or if the accident is serious.

Even minor injuries should be reported as some symptoms can show up later.

## **3\. Stay Calm and Don't Admit Fault**

Keep your cool and avoid arguing or admitting fault at the scene. Let the insurance companies and police sort that out.

## **4\. Document Everything**

Use your phone to take clear photos of:

* *Damage to all vehicles*

* *License plates*

* *Driver's license \+ insurance slip of the other driver*

* *Street signs or intersection*

If there are witnesses, get their contact info too as it may be helpful later.

## **5\. Exchange Info with the Other Driver**

Swap:

* *Name \+ phone number*

* *Driver's license number*

* *License plate*

* *Insurance company \+ policy number*

## **6\. Call the Police (If Needed)**

In Ontario and most provinces, you must report the accident to police if:

* There's over $2,000 in damage

* Someone is injured

* A criminal offence (e.g., impaired driving) is suspected

If police don't come to the scene, you may need to visit a Collision Reporting Centre within 24 hours.

## **7\. Report to Your Insurance Company**

Call your insurance provider as soon as possible, ideally the same day. Provide:

* *All photos \+ documents*

* *Police report (if applicable)*

* *Details of what happened*


## **8\. Follow Up**

Keep a copy of:

* *The accident report*

* *Any repair estimates*

* *Insurance claim details*

Stay in touch with your insurance adjuster and ask questions if anything's unclear.

**Conclusion:**  
Being involved in a car accident is never easy. But in a high-stress moment, knowing exactly what to do can help you stay safe, protect your legal rights, and ensure a smoother recovery process. From calling emergency services to documenting the scene and reporting to the proper authorities, each step plays a vital role in resolving the situation responsibly. Your actions in those first few minutes matter more than you think.
