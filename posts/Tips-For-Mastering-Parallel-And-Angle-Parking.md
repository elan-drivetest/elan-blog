### **Step-by-Step Guide to Parallel Parking**

**1. Find the Right Spot** â€“ *Choose a parking space at least one and a half times the length of your car. Avoid spaces near driveways or fire hydrants to prevent fines.*

**2. Signal and Position Your Vehicle** â€“ *Turn on your signal and align your car parallel to the vehicle in front of the empty space, keeping about 2 feet of distance. Ensure your rear bumper aligns with the other carâ€™s bumper for precise positioning.*

**3. Reverse Slowly** â€“ *Shift into reverse, turning the wheel sharply towards the curb while checking mirrors and blind spots. Move back cautiously to avoid hitting obstacles.*

**4. Straighten and Adjust** â€“ *Once your car is at a 45-degree angle, straighten the wheel and continue reversing until your vehicle is properly positioned.*

**5. Final Adjustments** â€“ *If needed, pull forward slightly to center your car within the space.*

**6. Check Your Position** â€“ *Make sure your car is legally parked, avoiding crosswalks, bike lanes, and driveways.*

## **Angle Parking Made Easy**

Angle parking is commonly used in parking lots and designated street parking zones. Follow these steps to do it correctly:

**2. Signal and Turn** â€“ *Indicate your intent and turn the wheel smoothly into the parking space. Avoid turning too sharply to prevent hitting curbs or other vehicles.*

**3. Align Within the Lines** â€“ *Ensure your car is centered within the parking lines before stopping.*

**4. Check Surroundings** â€“ *Before exiting, scan for pedestrians, cyclists, and nearby vehicles.*

**5. Backing Out Safely** â€“ *When leaving, reverse slowly while checking for oncoming cars. Use mirrors and turn your head to scan blind spots.*
