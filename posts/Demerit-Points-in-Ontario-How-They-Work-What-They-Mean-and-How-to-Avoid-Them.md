# Demerit Points in Ontario: How They Work, What They Mean, and How to Avoid Them

If you're a licensed driver in Ontario, understanding how demerit points work is essential for protecting your driving privileges. Contrary to what some believe, demerit points are not rewardsâ€”they're penalties added to your driving record when you commit traffic offences.

Let's break down how Ontario's demerit point system works, what offences carry points, and what happens when you accumulate too many.

### **What Are Demerit Points?**

Demerit points are part of Ontario's system for monitoring driver behaviour. When you are convicted of certain traffic violations, the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) adds demerit points to your driving record, not subtracts them.

These points are meant to discourage unsafe driving habits. The more serious the offence, the more points you receive.

### **How Demerit Points Are Applied**

Demerit points are applied only after you're convicted of a traffic offence. Here's how it works:

1. You're pulled over and issued a ticket.

2. If you pay the ticket or are found guilty in court, the conviction is recorded.

3. The corresponding number of demerit points is added to your record.

The MTO tracks points for all driversâ€”including G1, G2, G, and commercial licence holders.

### **Common Offences and Their Demerit Points**

Here are examples of common traffic violations and the number of demerit points they carry in Ontario:

#### **6 Points**

* *Failing to stop for a school bus*

* *Racing or stunt driving*

* *Careless driving*

* *Exceeding speed limit by 50 km/h or more*

#### **4 Points**

* *Exceeding speed limit by 30â€“49 km/h*

* *Following too closely*

* *Failing to stop at a pedestrian crossing*

#### **3 Points**

* *Failing to yield right-of-way*

* *Running a red light*

* *Driving through a stop sign*

* *Improper passing or turning*

#### **2 Points**

* *Failing to signal*

* *Unnecessary noise*

* *Driving without headlights*

### **What Happens If You Accumulate Too Many Demerit Points?**

#### **For Fully Licensed Drivers (G licence):**

* **6â€“8 points:** You'll receive a warning letter.

* **9â€“14 points:** You may be required to attend an interview to explain why your licence shouldn't be suspended.

* **15+ points:** Your driver's licence will be suspended for 30 days.

#### **For Novice Drivers (G1 or G2):**

* **2â€“5 points:** Warning letter.

* **6+ points:** Licence suspension or cancellation may occur.

Once suspended, you'll need to surrender your licence, and in many cases, you'll have to pay a reinstatement fee to get it back.

### **How Long Do Demerit Points Stay on Your Record?**

Demerit points stay on your driving record for two years from the date of the offence. After that, they are automatically removed. However, your full driving record, including convictions, may remain visible for longer.

### **How to Avoid Demerit Points**

* Follow traffic laws, especially around school zones, intersections, and highways.

* Take a defensive driving course to brush up on safe practices.

* Be extra cautious as a new driver (G1 or G2)â€”your margin for error is much smaller.

* If you believe a ticket was issued in error, fight the charge in court to prevent a conviction.

### **Final Thoughts**

Understanding the demerit point system is more than just knowing the numbersâ€”it's about becoming a safer, more responsible driver. Whether you're new to Ontario roads or a seasoned commuter, keeping your record clean helps you avoid fines, licence suspensions, and insurance hikes.
