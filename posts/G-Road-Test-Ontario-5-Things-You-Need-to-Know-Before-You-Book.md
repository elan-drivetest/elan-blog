Getting your full G licence in Ontario is a huge step. It unlocks full driving privileges and can even lower your insurance rates. But the test itself? It's more advanced than your G2 and comes with a few surprises if you're not prepared.

Here are 5 key things you need to know before you show up at the DriveTest centre for your G road test:

### **1. It Includes Highway Driving**

Unlike the G2 test, your G test includes highway and expressway driving. This means merging, lane changes at high speeds, and exiting safely. You'll be expected to show confidence and control on the highway.

Tip: Practice entering and exiting on-ramps, maintaining speed, and checking blind spots.

### **2. You'll Be Judged on Advanced Skills**

This isn't just a repeat of your G2. The examiner is watching for things like:

* Smooth lane changes
* Proper spacing and speed
* 360Â° awareness
* Defensive driving habits

Confidence tip: *Don't just pass â€” impress*. Drive like someone who deserves a full license.

### **3. Your Vehicle Must Be Test-Ready**

Your car must be in good working condition. That means:

* Working lights, horn, and signals
* Clean windows
* Proper insurance and registration

If your vehicle doesn't pass the pre-check, your test can be cancelled on the spot.

### **4. You Can (and Should) Practice the Route**

DriveTest doesn't publish official routes, but many test centres use common patterns. Look up forums, YouTube videos, or talk to local drivers to get a sense of the area.

Tip: Practice in the area around your DriveTest location so you're not caught off guard.

### **5. Weather Can Change Everything**

Ontario's weather is famously unpredictable. You might face rain, fog, or even snow on test day. Stay calm, adapt your driving to the conditions, and show the examiner you can handle anything Mother Nature throws your way.
