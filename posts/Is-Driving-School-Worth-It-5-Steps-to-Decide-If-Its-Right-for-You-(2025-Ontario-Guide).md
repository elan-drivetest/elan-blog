The truth is, driving school can be a major advantage for many learners, but it's not always necessary for everyone. In this blog, we'll walk you through 5 quick steps to help you decide if driving school is right for you!

### **Step 1: Know the Real Benefits of Driving School**

Driving school isn't just about learning how to turn and park—it can also offer some major perks:

* **Skip the 12-month wait**: MTO-approved courses reduce your G2 wait time to just 8 months

* **Insurance discounts**: Most companies offer lower premiums for certified drivers

* **Confidence**: You'll get hands-on, real-world driving practice in various road conditions

* **Structured lessons**: You'll learn the rules of the road from certified instructors

### **Step 2: Ask Yourself — How Comfortable Are You Behind the Wheel?**

Think about your current driving experience.  
Are you completely new? Nervous in traffic? Or have you already had lots of practice with a parent or friend?

**Driving school might be for you if:**

* *You've never driven before*

* *You feel nervous on the road*

* *You want a clear learning path*

**You might be okay without it if:**

* *You've been practicing regularly*

* *You're confident with highway, city, and parking maneuvers*

* *You've driven in test conditions already*

### **Step 3: Consider the Cost (and Value)**

Driving school usually costs between $600 and $1,000 in Ontario. That includes:

* *In-car lessons*

* *Online or in-class theory*

* *Certificate for insurance savings*

* *Practice for real test scenarios*

Note: Insurance companies often reward certified drivers with 10–20% off your premium, so over time  it can pay for itself.

### **Step 4: Think About Your Test Location**

Some DriveTest Centres in Ontario are harder than others. If you're testing in a high-traffic area, a few lessons with a pro can make a big difference.

**"Pro tip:** GrayJays Driving School offers targeted practice in areas like Markham, North York , and Scarborough—so you can get familiar with the exact roads you'll be tested on.

### **Step 5: Choose Based on Your Learning Style**

Everyone learns differently. If you prefer:

* *Structured lessons*

* *One-on-one coaching*

* *Step-by-step practice with feedback*

…then driving school will likely make your driving smoother and help with weak spots.

### **Final Thoughts: Is Driving School Worth It?**

Here's the quick answer:

YES — if you're new, nervous, or want to save time and money  
MAYBE — if you've already had lots of practice and feel test-ready
