# Ontario Driving Trends 2025: What Every New Driver Should Know


Thinking about taking your G2 or G test this year? Curious how safe Ontario roads really are?  
In this article we'll go through the most recent stats available (from the Ministry of Transportation) to give you an overview of Ontario's driving scene in 2025—from pass rates to collision data and how new drivers are doing on the road.

This is a must-read if you're prepping for a road test, or just want to be a safer, smarter driver.

**How Many Drivers Are on the Road in Ontario?**

As of the latest figures, over 10.6 million licensed drivers are on Ontario roads. And that number continues to rise in 2025, especially with more G1 and G2 drivers entering the system.

### **G2 & G Test Pass Rates in Ontario**

Pass rates have stayed fairly consistent in recent years:

* G2 (G1 Exit): \~ 53%

* G (G2 Exit): \~ 65%

That means nearly 1 in 2 drivers fail their G2 test on the first try. Common reasons?  
\- *Not checking mirrors*  
*\- Nervous lane changes*  
*\- Parking errors*

### **Ontario Collision Data (Latest data from 2023\)**

While full 2025 stats are still pending, the most recent annual report shows:

* *26,993 injury collisions*

* *568 fatal crashes*

* *Total Vehicles Involved in Fatal & Personal Injury Collisions: 49,708*

**Top causes:**

- Distracted driving 

- speeding 

- Impaired driving

- Bad weather

### **Young Drivers: Risk vs. Readiness**

Drivers aged 16–24 are the largest group of new road test applicants. The good news?  
They tend to pass earlier and have more confidence.

The not-so-good news?  
They're also more likely to be involved in accidents within their first year.

That's why driver training and practice are key for learners.

### **Where Are the Hardest DriveTest Locations?**

Based on reviews and road test experiences, these centres continue to be the most challenging:

* **Oakville: G pass rate of 55%**

* **Mississauga: G pass rate of 57%**

* **Brampton: G pass rate of 59%​**

High traffic \+ complex road layouts \= lower pass rates.

Tip: Check your test centre's layout and plan ahead to avoid surprises.

### **What Ontario Driving Trends Tell Us in 2025**

* *There are more drivers on the road than ever*

* *Pass rates are still a challenge*
