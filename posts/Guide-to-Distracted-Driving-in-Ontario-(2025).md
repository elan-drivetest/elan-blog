**What Every Driver Needs to Know to Stay Safe & Legal**

Distracted driving remains one of the leading causes of collisions in Ontario. Whether you're a seasoned commuter or a new G2 driver, understanding the rules and the risks can save lives, money, and your licence. In this guide, we'll break down what counts as distracted driving, the latest 2025 stats, what penalties you could face, and how to avoid common mistakes.

## **What is Distracted Driving?**

In Ontario, distracted driving is defined as any activity that removes your focus from the road, including:

* *Texting or talking on the phone (even at red lights!)*

* *Eating or drinking*

* *Adjusting your GPS*

* *Reaching for items*

* *Grooming (yes, makeup counts!)*

According to the Ministry of Transportation, if you're caught using a handheld device, you're breaking the law. Even if you're stopped at a traffic light.
