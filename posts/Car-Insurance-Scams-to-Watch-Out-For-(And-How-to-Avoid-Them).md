## **Staged Accidents – *The Classic Trap***

**What it is:** Scammers intentionally cause accidents to make it look like your fault.  
**Common setups include:**

* Swoop and Squat: *A car cuts you off and slams the brakes.*

* Drive Down: *You're waved to merge or turn, only to get hit.*

* T-Bone Setup: *Someone speeds through an intersection and blames you.*

**Red flags:**

* Multiple passengers complaining of injury

* Pushy drivers insisting you skip the police

* Witnesses appearing "out of nowhere"

**Tip:** Always call the police, take photos, and document everything.

## **Fake Insurance Agents**

**What it is:** Scammers pose as agents, offering fake policies at "too-good-to-be-true" prices.

**How they trick you:**

* *Selling policies through social media or unofficial websites*

* *Using legitimate company names but spoofed contacts*

* *Asking for payment via cash apps or wire transfers*

**Red flags:**

* No physical address or phone number

* Vague policy documents

* Pressure to "buy now before rates go up"

**Tip:** Only buy insurance from verified providers or compare rates using trusted platforms like [Ratehub](https://www.ratehub.ca/) or [LowestRates.ca](https://www.lowestrates.ca/).

## **Phantom Claims – *Damage That Doesn't Exist***

**What it is:** After a real accident, scammers exaggerate injuries or vehicle damage to increase the payout.

**Tactics include:**

* *Inflating repair estimates*

* *Claiming injuries that aren't verifiable*

* *Using fake repair shops or doctors*

**Tip:** Request to see all repair estimates and reports. If it feels off, report it to your insurance company.

## **Ghost Brokers – Cheap Coverage That Vanishes**

**What it is:** Fraudsters act as brokers, "selling" real insurance at a discount—except they pocket your money and give you fake papers.

**You'll only find out it's fake when:**

* *You try to make a claim*

* *You're pulled over and fined for no insurance*

**Tip:** Always check the broker's license through [Registered Insurance Brokers of Ontario (RIBO)](https://www.ribo.com/).

## **Crash-for-Cash Rings – Organized Insurance Crime**

These aren't just one-off scams—some fraud rings involve tow truck drivers, repair shops, and medical clinics working together to stage accidents and split the payout.

**Tip:** If you're in a crash and a tow truck appears within seconds, be cautious. Ask for credentials and choose your own repair shop when possible.

## **Staying Informed Matters**

Auto insurance scams cost Canadians over $1 billion a year! That cost gets passed on to you in the form of higher premiums—even if you're not at fault.

Being aware protects not just your money, but your identity, your license, and your peace of mind.

## **What To Do If You Suspect a Scam**

1. *Report it to your insurance company immediately*

2. *Contact the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) at 1-844-227-5422*

3. File a report with the police if necessary

### **Final Thoughts**

Insurance fraud might feel like a distant issue until it directly impacts your wallet, your driving record, or your peace of mind. The best defense is awareness. Stay sharp, trust your gut, and never sign anything without doing your homework. A few extra minutes of caution can save you from months of stress and financial loss.
