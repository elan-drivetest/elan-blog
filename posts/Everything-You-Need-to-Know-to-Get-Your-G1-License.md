# Everything You Need to Know to Get Your G1 License 2025 🚗📝

Canada's driver's licensing system varies by province and territory, but most regions follow a **Graduated Licensing System (GLS)** with multiple stages before obtaining a full license. The first stage is acquiring a **G1 license** which is a beginner's permit that allows new drivers to start practicing under supervision, setting them on the path toward a full driver's license. In this article we'll cover everything you need to know to get your G1 license.

## 📋 What Is a G1 License?

A **G1 license**, also known as a **learner's permit**, is the first stage of Ontario's graduated licensing system (GLS). It allows new drivers to practice under specific restrictions before moving on to the G2 and full G licenses. Other provinces have similar systems, but this guide focuses on Ontario, Quebec and other regions that have G1/Learners permit as the first step of their GLS.

## ✅ Eligibility Requirements

To apply for a G1 license, you must:

- **Be at least 16 years old**
- **Pass a vision test**
- **Pass a written knowledge test** on road rules and traffic signs
- **Provide valid identification** (passport, birth certificate, or permanent resident card)

## 🔄 How to Apply for a G1 License

### Step-by-Step Application Process

1. **Visit a DriveTest Centre**: Locate a nearby [DriveTest](https://drivetest.ca/) Centre where G1 tests are conducted.

2. **Take a Vision Test**: This ensures you meet the necessary vision standards for safe driving.

3. **Write the Knowledge Test**: A multiple-choice exam covering Ontario's road rules, traffic laws, and signs.

4. **Pay the Fees**: The G1 package fee covers the test and the five-year license (currently around $158.25 CAD).

5. **Receive Your G1 License**: If you pass, you'll receive a temporary paper license, with your official card arriving by mail.

> **Pro Tip:** Arrive early at the DriveTest centre as they often get busy, especially on weekends and during summer months. Check the [current wait times](https://drivetest.ca/find-a-drivetest-centre/wait-times/) before going.

The knowledge test consists of two sections:

- **Rules of the road** (40 questions)
  - Right-of-way rules
  - Speed limits
  - Emergency procedures
  - Fines and penalties
  - Defensive driving techniques

- **Road signs** (20 questions)
  - Warning signs
  - Regulatory signs
  - Traffic signals
  - Construction signs
  - Directional signs

You need to score at least **80%** in each section to pass (32/40 and 16/20).

Here's a [Guide To Canadian Road Signs and Traffic Laws](https://blog.elandrivetestrental.ca/posts/Ultimate-Beginners-Guide-To-Canadian-Road-Signs-And-Traffic-Regulations)

The test is available in multiple languages and is taken on a touchscreen computer at DriveTest Centres.

> **Study Tip:** Purchase the [Official MTO Driver's Handbook](https://www.publications.gov.on.ca/drivers-handbook), which covers all test topics. You can also take [practice tests](https://www.ontario.ca/document/official-mto-drivers-handbook/test-yourself-sample-knowledge-test-questions) online to familiarize yourself with the format.

## ⚠️ G1 License Restrictions

Once you pass, you can start driving—but with strict rules. The G1 license comes with restrictions such as the following:

1. **Must drive with a fully licensed (G) driver** with 4+ years of experience who sits in the front passenger seat

2. **Zero alcohol or drugs** while driving (zero tolerance policy)

3. **No driving between midnight and 5 AM**

4. **No driving on 400-series highways** or high-speed expressways (unless with a licensed driving instructor)

5. **All passengers must wear seatbelts**

6. **No electronic devices** while driving (even hands-free)

These restrictions help new drivers gain experience in controlled conditions and develop safe driving habits from the beginning.

> **Important:** Breaking G1 restrictions can result in fines, demerit points, license suspension, and even extend the time before you can take your G2 road test. Learn more about [penalties for novice drivers](https://www.ontario.ca/page/official-mto-drivers-handbook/penalties-driving-offences).

## ⏱️ How Long Does It Take to Get a Full License?

The typical timeline from G1 to a full G license is:

- **G1 License** → Hold for 12 months
- **G2 Road Test** → If you pass, get G2 license
- **G2 License** → Hold for 12 months
- **G Test** → If you pass, get full G license

**Fast Track Option:** If you complete an [approved driver education course](https://www.ontariodriversafety.ca/approved-driving-schools.html), you can take the G2 road test after only 8 months with your G1.

Total time: Minimum of 20 months (with driver education) or 24 months (without).
