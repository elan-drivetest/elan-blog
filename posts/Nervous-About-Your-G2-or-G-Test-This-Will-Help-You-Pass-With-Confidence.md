Nervous about your road test? You're not alone. Whether you're going for your G2 or G license, it's completely normal to feel a few butterflies. But too many jitters can affect your focus and performance behind the wheel.

At Elan, we know how important it is to feel calm, confident, and prepared on test day. Here are our top tips to help you conquer those pre-test nerves and show the examiner your best driving.

### **1\. Practice With Purpose**

Don't just drive around aimlessly â€” practice the skills you're likely to be tested on:

* Parallel parking

* Three-point turns

* Lane changes

* Left and right turns at intersections

* Highway merging (for G tests)

The more you practice these, the more automatic they become, which means less stress on test day.

### **2\. Know the Area**

DriveTest routes aren't officially published, but that doesn't mean you have to go in blind. Most centres follow similar patterns like common intersections, local streets, and nearby residential zones.

**Here's what you can do:**

* Ask recent test-takers what route they got

* Practice near your test centre to get comfortable with the surroundings

* Look up videos or tips online for your specific location (some testers even share dashcam footage\!)

When you know what to expect, you're less likely to be caught off guard and more likely to drive with calm, steady confidence.

### **3\. Sleep Well the Night Before**

A good night's sleep helps your body stay calm and your mind stay sharp. Avoid late-night cramming or over-practicing the night before. Trust your training and rest up.

### **4. Arrive Early â€” But Not Too Early**

Give yourself a calm start by arriving at the DriveTest centre 30 to 45 minutes ahead of time. This gives you a chance to:

* Find parking 

* Settle your nerves 

* Go over last-minute tips 

* Use the washroom 

But here's the trick â€” don't show up hours early. Sitting around too long can give your nerves time to spiral. You want just enough time to feel settled, not stressed.

### **5\. Bring the Right Vehicle** 

Your road test car isn't just transportation, it's part of your exam. Choose a vehicle you're 100% comfortable in, with reliable brakes, signals, mirrors, and no warning lights. It should feel familiar and test-ready.

Don't leave it to chance as examiners can cancel your test if your vehicle doesn't meet DriveTest standards.

### **6\. Think of the Examiner as a Passenger**

It's easy to feel intimidated by the person holding the clipboard but here's the truth: your examiner isn't looking to fail you. Their job is to make sure you're safe, not perfect.

Think of them as a regular passenger who just wants a calm, smooth ride. Focus on driving like you would if a family member or friend were in the car â€” cautious, confident, and aware.

**Pro tip:** Stay polite, don't overthink their silence, and trust your training. You've got this.


### **7\. Visualize Success**

Before your test, take a quiet moment to close your eyes and picture the drive:  
*You're calm. Your hands are steady. Every turn, stop, and signal flows smoothly. You're focused, in control â€” and passing with confidence.*

This simple mental exercise, called visualization, actually trains your brain to perform better under pressure. Pro athletes do it. Top performers swear by it. And now, so can you.

### **8\. Made a Mistake? Keep Driving.**

Everyone slips up even during the road test. Maybe you took a turn a little wide or braked a bit too hard. One small mistake won't fail you. What matters most is how you recover and keep going.

Don't let a minor error derail your focus. The examiner is watching for safe, responsible driving, not perfection.

**Mindset tip:** If something goes wrong, take a breath and reset. Stay present, stay calm, and finish strong. 

### **9\. Get Support From Elan**
